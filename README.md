1. How I approached the assignment
I started by planning the structure of the website using React and Vite. I created separate components like Header, Hero, Feature, Team, CTA, and Footer to keep everything organized. I added basic styling and made sure each section looked clean and was easy to understand. After building the layout, I tested the app locally and then pushed the code to GitHub to make it public and professional.

2. What issues I faced while building the project
While working on the project, I faced a few small problems:
- The images didn’t show up at first because they weren’t placed in the correct folder.
- The layout wasn’t centered properly, so I had to adjust the CSS styles.
- Git showed a warning about author identity, which I fixed by setting my name and email.
- Some line ending warnings appeared, but they didn’t affect the project.
